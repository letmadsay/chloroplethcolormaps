# chloroplethcolormaps

This was an attempt to try out the stuff taught at R Ladies Meetup Colombo, Sri Lanka 
I have added furthermore code that I have tried out further by addressing the following,

01 | Reversing palette
02 | Labelling
03 | Gradients
04 | Rainbow or no rainbow palette
05 | Color deficiencies
